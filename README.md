# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

Currently working as a Senior Quality Engineer in Electronics.  I spend about 90% of my time studying large data sets and optimizing my Power BI dashboards for the company where I use DAX, M, and HTTP/S to talk to the REST API server.

My first programming language was C++.  I also study data science using programming languages like Python, SQL, and R.

Regards,
Dave Ruckel
